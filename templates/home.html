        <h1>Welcome to Secure Blog!</h1>
        <p>Security should be built into applications from the very start, not added at the end. 
            This blog is a space to demonstrate how simple web apps can be made more secure using 
            DevSecOps practices.</p>
        <p>If youâ€™re new to this field, think of each example here as a building block showing how 
            development, security, and operations work together to protect modern applications.</p>
